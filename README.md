# Nut Job - a Science Hack Day 2019 project

You're a squirrel headed over to Hasenheide. How do you get there? 
Nut Job provides squirrels and other rodent friends with tree-to-tree navigation from A to B.

Select two trees on the map and click GetRoute to find the shortest path using only trees.
As of now, squirrel navigation is only available in GÃ¶rlitzer Park. More to come soon!

**TreeFinder:** The `/TreeFinder/` submodule contains a standalone web app to find the closest tree to you.

## Setup

### Frontend 
To get the frontend running on your machine enter `/frontend` folder 
```
npm i
npm run start
```
If the correct address does not open automatically, use `localhost:3000`.

### Backend
Disclaimer: For the backend to work you need more than 8GB RAM. 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py
```
The app is served on `localhost:5000`.
